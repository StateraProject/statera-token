# Statera
Statera token has a burn function which on every transaction sends 1% of the transaction amount to the burn address. It also uses a novel application of the Balancer Pool provided by Balancer.finance; a non-custodial portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor. Statera token captures the value of a diminishing circulating supply and the value of the pegged crypto assets appreciation in the index fund as well as a share of transaction fees on the Balancer platform. 

The Balancer Pool acts as a counterweight and market maker of the Statera (STA) token, the relative size of which dictates its influence and buying power. Adding liquidity to the pool yields a number of Balancer Pool Token (BPT) which represent a share of the fund. BPT can  be redeemed for the underlying token assets at any time.
